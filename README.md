The data displayed from various schools shows student performance in reading and writing in comparison to school size, type, and budget. While there are some anticipated relationships, a few unsuspected results also present themself. Generally speaking, some key takeaways:
* Charter schools tend to have better scores and passing rates. 
* Students have higher scores in reading
* A higher percentage of students are passing reading

Some comparisons that are worth noting:
* The top performing schools are not spending more money per capita. While Charter schools top the list, overall the schools spending less money, are out performing those who spend more.
* Smaller schools have significantly higher scores than larger schools. For example, schools with less than 1000 students have a 17% higher overall passing rate compared to those with 2000-5000 students. 

Determining why these results are occuring would take further investigation, however they do provide stakeholders with an opportunity to objectively compare school performance.
